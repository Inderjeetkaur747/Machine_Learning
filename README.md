This repository contains my complete Machine Learning learning path, implemented step-by-step in a single Jupyter Notebook.
It covers everything from data preprocessing → supervised learning → unsupervised learning → ensemble learning, along with practical examples and visualizations.

I created this notebook to revise all ML concepts, strengthen my interview prep, and help others starting their ML journey.

 What’s Inside the Notebook?
🔹 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Outlier detection (IQR, Z-Score)

Data transformation & normalization

Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding

Feature scaling (MinMax, StandardScaler)

Train/Test splitting

Handling imbalanced datasets (SMOTE)

🔹 2. Supervised Learning
Classification & Regression Models

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Naive Bayes

Model Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy • Precision • Recall • F1-Score • Confusion Matrix • ROC-AUC

🔹 3. Unsupervised Learning

K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering

DBSCAN

PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)

Evaluation:
Elbow Method • Silhouette Score

🔹 4. Ensemble Learning

Bagging (Random Forest)

Boosting (AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, XGBoost)


Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

XGBoost

Project Goal

This notebook helps to:

Build a strong understanding of ML foundations
